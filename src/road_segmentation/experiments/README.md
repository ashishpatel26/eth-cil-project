Implementation of the three FCDenseNets, (FCDenseNet56, FCDenseNet67 and FCDenseNet103) introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09326).
The experiment is as truthful to the original paper as possible, with only a few differences, and serves as a baseline
to compare other experiments to.
